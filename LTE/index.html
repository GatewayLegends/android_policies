                <ul class="location-items">
                  <p>The app uses location in foreground to determine the correct location latitude and longitude
                     when the app is in foreground and the Network Status Test has been initiated by the user. Foreground location can be 
                     allowed by choosing "Allow While using app" at location access prompt. 
                     If location is allowed the app will add the measurements while the app is running. 
                     If foreground location is not allowed the drive run cannot be started.</p>
